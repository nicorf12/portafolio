My education includes the study of multiple programming paradigms, operating systems, networks, and computer security fundamentals.

Throughout my studies, I have worked with languages such as C, Java, Go, Python, and Clojure, which allowed me to develop a solid understanding of different approaches to problem solving and system design.`},{title:"Interests and Passions",description:`I am passionate about understanding how systems work at their core and analyzing how they can be compromised. This constant curiosity led me to develop a strong interest in cybersecurity.

I enjoy both the challenge of securing systems and the process of developing solutions to complex problems. The intersection between software development and security is where I find the greatest motivation.`}],goals:[{title:"Specialization",description:"To specialize in cybersecurity, with a focus on ethical pentesting and vulnerability analysis, aiming to protect critical systems and sensitive data."},{title:"Continuous Development",description:"To continue expanding my knowledge in different areas of software development in order to approach problems from multiple technical perspectives."},{title:"Real Impact",description:"To contribute to projects that generate a positive impact by protecting the privacy and security of individuals and organizations."}],summary:"Although my main interest lies in cybersecurity, I believe versatility is essential in technology.
